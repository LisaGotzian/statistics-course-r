## Statistics basics for bachelors

This is a full set of slides for a statistics course on an undergrad level. It is accompanied with basic R exercises. For a more comprehensive introduction to R itself as a programming language, please refer to my other classes!  

The course is designed for environmental scientists and therefore uses examples from sustainability research. As a methods course however, I welcome an occasional sustainability input with the main contents unchanged. I cover the following topics:
* data types and its use
* probability distributions
* simple tests
* correlations
* linear models
* analysis of variance
* scientific papers and a methodological walk-through through two selected papers


My philosophy is to search for the “common ground”, the starting point in each topic. I try to explain the new topic at the earliest point the students will understand to then progress through the topic. I highly value clear visuals, and that’s why **my slides are the absolute go-to for my lecture**. The visuals will tell you everything you need.
(Almost) everything I wrote on the blackboard is also in the slides and marked as such.
