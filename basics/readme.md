# Statistics basics for bachelors

This is a full set of slides for a **statistics course on an undergrad level**. It is accompanied with basic R exercises. For a more comprehensive introduction to R itself as a programming language, please refer to my other classes! The course was part of a module by [Prof. Dr. Henrik von Wehrden at Leuphana University](https://henrikvonwehrden.leuphana.de).  

The course is designed for environmental scientists and therefore uses examples from sustainability research. As a methods course however, I welcome an occasional sustainability input with the main contents unchanged. I cover the following topics:
* data types and its use (#2)
* probability distributions (#3)
* simple tests (#4)
* correlations (#5)
* linear models (#6)
* analysis of variance (#7)
* scientific papers and a methodological walk-through through two selected papers ([Klein et al., 2003](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2002.2306); [Bullock et al., 2001](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1461-0248.2001.00215.x)) (#8)


My philosophy is to search for the “common ground”, the starting point in each topic. I try to explain the new topic at the earliest point the students will understand to then progress through the topic. I highly value clear visuals, and that’s why **my slides are the absolute go-to for my lecture**. The visuals will tell you everything you need.
(Almost) everything I wrote on the blackboard is also in the slides and marked as such.
